                <h3>“Handicrafts are goods predominantly made by hand even though some tools or machinery may also have been used in the process; such goods are graced with visual appeal in the nature of ornamentation of in-lay work or some similar work of a substantial nature; possess distinctive features, which can be aesthetic, artistic, ethnic or culturally
                     attached and are amply different from mechanically produced goods of similar utility” </h3>
